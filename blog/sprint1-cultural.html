        <h3>Identities, values and strengths.</h3>

<h4>What do I think the world needs from me?</h4>

<ul>
<li>1) On my wall, I have a corkboard with a series of pinned notes listing goals I have for my life. With them I orient myself towards what I want in life. One post it reads "start a family", another "help build a school or community space". Plant 10,000 trees, live for a week without speaking English (my only fluent language), and publish 10 board games.
While the last of these is definitely career oriented (I'm a passionate game designer), most of these are about using what I have to cultivate growth and new life, whether in social spaces or ecological. This is actually something I recently updated my resume to reference actually, which leads nicely onto the next point... </li>
<li>2) When I was at school, I did a lot of extra curricular activities. A lot of them were very academic, like quiz teams and debate teams, but there were things like choir groups, bands, sports teams. But the one thing I did in highschool that I always look back on with pride and satisfaction was PSSP - the Peer Sexuality Support Program. This was a program run by the Auckland Sexual Health Services in a number of Auckland highschools which worked from the premise that young people feel hesitant to get their information on sexual health from adults like teachers and parents, and thus that the apporpriate solution to New Zealand's crisis of terrible sexual health stats is to put effort into educating select highschoolers (those with strong leadership capacity) to act as educators for their peers and in their communities. Being part of this program was a formative experience for me in a way that nothing else from my teenage years really was. The particular sense of community and growth through vulnerability for 
the greater civic good remains a core of what I think society needs more of.</li>
<li>3) I feel like all my 'evidence' is anecdotal, but it would be inaccurate to talk about my values without talking about my strong leftist political opinions which hold the diversity and complexity of humanity, life and the universe generally as beautiful and positive, which translates into strong convictions in favour of decolonization, extracting humanity from the clutches of capitalism, adopting values more in line with a society in balance with a sustainable ecosphere, and smashing the patriarchy. I've done some organising with groups like the prison abolitionist collective People Against Prisons Aotearoa, donated to financially support the Protect Ihumatao movement, and occasionally donate to similar charities. </li>
<li>4) I like philosophy and methodical analytical thought. I mean just read this blog. I didn't use the word dialectical because I thought it sounded cool - I think the world makes more sense when you reevaluate the logics you apply to take into account that things are always somewhat defined by what they are not, and contradictions move us forward as they are resolved in our lives and in our minds. </li>
</ul>

<h4>What do I wish to cultivate more in myself?</h4>

<p>I believe that to be human is to grow, and to seek growth, despite what discomfort or pain it may cause us along the way to step outside of what we find familiar and safe. 
This is why I like to challenge myself with a whole bunch of different new things. 
Recently I've been exploring black swans and how to adopt that concept in my approach to living life and pursuing my goals.</p> 

<p>I believe my greatest need for growth is in the area of discipline and tenacity in pushing myself - I easily give into fear and angst about my life and my goals, getting twisted up in a dialectic of ambition and anxiety. 
My evidence is that although I've pursued many things in my life, I've become exceptional at very few, and fewer still of those were truly sources of passion for me. Even without the presumption that I would've attained any measure of great success, I think back to learning to play the piano accordion for some 7 years, and finding practice to be my biggest block, or to the years i spent at uni - unwilling to push myself to pass the courses i wasn't interested in, or admit that I wasn't interested in them and find something else to do with my life, or to address the problems with my mental health. I've since overcome these, and I hope these reflect changes in who I am as a person in ways that reach into the present and will follow me into the future, but I want to work on these. I'm here because I wanted to pursue something new, something I thought might be interesting and which is adjacent to the joy I find in game design and mathematics, and I'm typin this stuff out really close to the deadline because I'm 
still nailing down how exactly to get myself where I want to go no matter how the circumstances or the destination may change. </p>

<h4>Hi 5 test results </h4>

<ul>
    <li>1)THINKER
<p>Your objective is to think. Some get excited by exercising their biceps or triceps, you - by stretching your 'brain muscles' through deep thinking. It does not necessarily mean you are a very focused person. It just means you enjoy the mental activity and meaningful conversations. For your mind journeys, you perceive yourself as the best companion. This introspection allows you to digest complex information and ideas before communicating about it with the surrounding world. Who wouldn't like to have a team member who can simplify even most sophisticated concepts in a way that a 3-year-old would understand?</p>
</li>

<li>2)EMPATHISER
<p>Your objective is to be empathetic to others' emotions. No one can step into the others' shoes better than you - it comes so naturally to you. You might not agree with every perspective and emotion, but most importantly you are able to understand what the person is going though. It allows you to have personalized approach to everyone, to see their differences and specialties, to include them and to treat fairly. Naturally, it draws others to you, as you know exactly how they feel. In a team, such a strength based on kindness can be essential for mitigating conflicts by making sure all team members are aware of each other's emotions and challenges.</p>
</li>
<li>3) PHILOMATH
<p>Your objective is to learn new things. Due to your love of learning people tend to say you are a very curious person. You like to experiment with different styles of learning as well - in the end, there is something to learn from that as well, right? As it's the processes itself that excite you, you are not necessarily interested in becoming a subject matter expert. Instead you prefer learning something fast and then shift to a new thing to learn. Thanks to this strength, you learn very fast and thrive in short projects and dynamically changing environments. Needless to say, you will always be the one to contribute with new knowledge to your team as well.</p>
</li>
<li>4) STORYTELLER
<p>Your objective is to communicate a message. You are a natural storyteller and it's not only your natural talent but also a strength that you are constantly working on. You are always in search for a perfect phrase and powerful word combination to attract and to capture the attention of the audience. That's why people love listening to you. In your mind - the presentation and communication are everything. You might have the best idea or concept but in the end the way you present it is what makes a real difference. Strong communication skills make you a great addition to any team - be it for inspiring team members to act or for presenting the output of your work to external stakeholders.</p>
</li>
<li>5) DELIVERER
<p>Your objective is to take responsibility. If there is a person who is emotionally bound to follow through on all promises - then it's you. Your strong ethical principles do not let you to simply write missteps off on excuses and rationalizations. It holds true no matter how small or large is the issue you are dealing with. Your name and reputation depend on you being responsible for your commitments. That's why people love to have you in their team. When assigning new responsibilities, they look at you first. They are 100% sure that what'll get on your desk - will get done no matter what.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Honestly, the thing that strikes me as odd is the fact that empathiser is so high. While the top attribute doesnt surprise me in the slightest, any of the other of philomath, storyteller or deliverer I would've rated myself higher than my empathy. I suppose in a twist of amusing irony it's a reasonably empathetic thing to think of onesself as lacking in empathy. But still I can't help but think of times I was completely oblivious to how others were feeling, despite the fact that I value empathy really highly. Or at least I thought I did. I can, as the test puts it 'step into other's shoes,' but I often find that I have to quite deliberately attend to doing so, or I'll completely miss what's happening with other people while in my own world.

<h4>Accounts of friends and family</h4>

<p>
    Irene's description of me:
Peter is a soft-spoken, conscientious person who is very measured in his responses to people and ideas; always considering things thoughtfully and carefully before weighing in on a topic. There are elements of aloofness, where he is more self-contained and inward-looking but generally he is friendly and approachable. From knowing him personally, he is trustworthy, dependable and reliable. He has a strict moral code and values this in himself and in others greatly.
I think what drives him most is partially a sense of performance, where he would like to stand out in whatever he is doing, but overall he wants to impact the world in a positive way. Peter would not be satisfied working in a field that does not contribute towards the betterment of society, the lives of people or the environment.
</p> 

<p>
 Chelsea's description of me:
Achievement, inclusivity, learning, connection, mastery, growth, care. Maybe also - precision, evaluation, inquiry. Fundamentally a struggle between the messiness of life, and the clarity you desire. And being caring and a fast learner is your super power. Like you can succeed at most tasks, but that relies upon someone giving you one. Making life’s chaos into tasks is the learning edge.

<h4>1. Using the evidence, describe your core personal values</h4>
<p>
    A situation where I weighed ethical considerations was in cutting beef out of my diet. It's a first step towards vegetarianism in the interests of lessening the destruction of the environment associated with my existence. While I've long struggled with whether individual choices of consumption truly make a meaningful impact on the environmental devastation of our global levels of consumption (I say global, but it's mostly the global north, or western civilisation, whatever arbitrary title you want to give to Europe and it's colonial descendants), and whether doing a small thing was a salve on my conscience preventing me from making more substantive action, like becoming a vegan, or campaigning. But I'm learning to pick my battles, and realised that although not eating beef may cause me inconvenience and make virtually no immediate difference to society, it is the first step that must be taken to get to where I want to go. I evaluated whether I could be absolved of the responsibility, and I came up with the answer of no.
As a white person in a post colonial (in a strict technical legal sense, not in a ideological sense or in the sense of very meaningful political outcomes), in a lot of ways I'd say my culture has influenced me negatively, enforcing ideologies which justify unnecessary harm to sustain privileges for the few. I'm having to unlearn assumptions I made about the world as I was growing up in order to understand how the world works.
And yet, as someone born and raised in west auckland in Aotearoa, I grew up in relatively ideal proximity to a great variety of cultures and viewpoints for such a task of unlearning. And so, I feel fortunate for such ample opportunity to learn ways in which I've been wrong so that I can become a better person to others and help the world more generally as I move through it.
</p>
<h4>2. Using the evidence, describe your strengths and limitations.</h4>
<p>
    My strengths are a rigorous analytical approach, a sense of commitment to following through on promises, a fascination with learning (and an aptitude for learning quickly), and the ability to communicate well with people of many diverse backgrounds. 
I got this list from seeing the commonalities in my Hi 5 test results, my INTP myers-briggs result, and descriptions of my strengths and limitations from  multiple people close to me. 
</p>
<p>
    My keenness to learn new things will certainly help me at EDA, as will my desire to follow through on commitments: provided I entangle people to be accountable to for those commitments (I'm not very good at being committed to my own person). My analytical nature might pull me away from just-in-time learning and towards a dream of perfect knowledge, but understanding systems with a systematic approach is probably not going to be a massive drawback.

<p>
    Once at university for a chemistry paper, students in my course were randomly assigned to groups to do a collaborative project involving research and a presentation. Tension arose when one person was less than communicative and didn't turn up to the meetings which we tried to ensure everyone could attend in order to work out our plans, and then in order to compensate, both myself and another member of my group fell into doing more work on the assumption that the other person was acting in bad faith and avoiding doing a fair share of work. The reality was that a few miscommunications had made someone who missed out on a few discussion by chance seem like someone who was avoiding work to the group, and made the group seem like people who were going to cut the first one out of credit for circumstances beyond their control. This meant that miscommunication turned into communication breaking down entirely, and I did a lot more work on the project in order to compensate for having one less actively contributing 
team member. This was a poor approach, and while at the time I remember being confident that there wasn't actually anyone acting in bad faith, I wasn't sure how to solve the problem, so instead of communicating, I simply took the burden of the problem entirely on myself. This was a terrible approach to the problem: I pulled an all nighter and made sure I had enough sway with the people in the group to keep the missing member's name on the credits as if they had done the work, and in doing so, did an unfair amount of the work and took a lot of stressful responsibility for a project which would affect the grades of 3 other peers.
</p>
<p>
    Approaching the problem in hindsight, I think I should've made more effort to communicate and create a more even environment for collaboration. The member who couldn't meet up in person was basically excluded from planning, and they only missed it because they had to go to their job. If we'd been more open to finding ways to collaborate online, it's possible everyone would've been more evenly involved (although workng online does have drawbacks). Even if we simply look at how we responded to the tension though - potentially more effort could have been made to establish a clear line of communication, and the reason that didn't happen was because of the sponteneity of the roles we adopted. While we all took on responsibility for a chunk of the work on the research or the presentation, noone took a considered responsibility for the role of team manager/director. Then when I stepped into it de facto at the end, i was both working and managing the project, overworking myself. It is hard to justify for others that one person should take the lead, but it's something I doconsider with hindsight to that event.
